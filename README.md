# [open-museum.ch](https://github.com/open-museum/open-museum.ch/)

This repo makes all the magic of [open-museum.ch](https://open-museum.ch/):

- [Sapper/Svelte](https://github.com/open-museum/web), [d3shooter](https://github.com/open-museum/d3shooter) and [Janus Gateway](https://github.com/open-museum/janus-gateway-docker) powered front end of [open-museum.ch](https://open-museum.ch/)
- [Omeka S](https://github.com/open-museum/omeka-s-docker) cultural heritage object management system [collections.open-museum.ch](https://collections.open-museum.ch/)
- Reverse proxy from [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/) for the routing and securing of all traffic

nano .env
```

Create file stubs for Traefik
